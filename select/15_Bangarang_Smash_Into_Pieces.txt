I want you to follow me
Don't wanna be alone
Join me in conspiracy
Where we can be unknown

I just wanna feel alive
Sit back and enjoy the ride
We're taking off in time and space
Gotta get away

We're gonna party in my virtual reality
Baby, it's you and me
Bangarang
We're gonna party 'til the end of humanity
Sleep is the enemy
Bangarang
Say goodbye to lonely nights
With an artificial life
We're gonna party in my virtual reality
Baby, it's you and me
Bangarang, ba-bang, bangarang

The world is turning upside down
We're tryna drown the pain
I'm looking for a higher ground
I think I found the way
I refuse to walk alone
Sick of being on my own
We're taking off in time and space
Gotta get away

We're gonna party in my virtual reality
Baby, it's you and me
Bangarang
We're gonna party 'til the end of humanity
Sleep is the enemy
Bangarang
Say goodbye to lonely nights
With an artificial life
We're gonna party in my virtual reality
Baby, it's you and me
Bangarang, ba-bang, bangarang

Ba-bang, bangarang
Bang, bangarang
(Bangarang)

I want you to follow me
Don't wanna be alone

We're gonna party in my virtual reality
Baby, it's you and me
Bangarang
We're gonna party 'til the end of humanity
Sleep is the enemy
Bangarang
Say goodbye to lonely nights
With an artificial life
We're gonna party in my virtual reality
Baby, it's you and me
Bangarang, ba-bang, bangarang

(Ba-bang, bangarang)
